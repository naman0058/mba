deal with the initialization\n   * of any custom state beyond the basic definition of the poller. The basic poller assumes that the poller's\n   * operation has already been defined, at least its basic properties. The code below shows how to approach\n   * the definition of the constructor of a new custom poller.\n   *\n   * ```ts\n   * export class MyPoller extends Poller<MyOperationState, string> {\n   *   constructor({\n   *     // Anything you might need outside of the basics\n   *   }) {\n   *     let state: MyOperationState = {\n   *       privateProperty: private,\n   *       publicProperty: public,\n   *     };\n   *\n   *     const operation = {\n   *       state,\n   *       update,\n   *       cancel,\n   *       toString\n   *     }\n   *\n   *     // Sending the operation to the parent's constructor.\n   *     super(operation);\n   *\n   *     // You can assign more local properties here.\n   *   }\n   * }\n   * ```\n   *\n   * Inside of this constructor, a new promise is created. This will be used to\n   * tell the user when the poller finishes (see `pollUntilDone()`). The promise's\n   * resolve and reject methods are also used internally to control when to resolve\n   * or reject anyone waiting for the poller to finish.\n   *\n   * The constructor of a custom implementation of a poller is where any serialized version of\n   * a previous poller's operation should be deserialized into the operation sent to the\n   * base constructor.
